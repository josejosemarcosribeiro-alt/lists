PROJECT: Node.js Classifieds System
REPO: https://github.com/josejosemarcosribeiro-alt/lists.git
TASK: Migrate video upload from AWS S3 to Cloudinary

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. routes/list.js
   - Replace AWS S3 config with Cloudinary config
   - Use multer-storage-cloudinary for uploads
   - Save uploaded video URL in MongoDB field 'videoPath'
   - Keep add, edit, delete, get item routes functional
   - Preserve authentication and text validation

2. views/add_list.pug
   - Keep enctype="multipart/form-data"
   - File input for video (optional)
   - Optional: add preview after upload via Cloudinary URL
   - Preserve text fields (title, body)

3. views/edit_list.pug
   - Replace local video src with Cloudinary URL (src=item.videoPath)
   - File input to replace video (optional)
   - Preserve title and body fields
   - Form still uses enctype="multipart/form-data"

PACKAGES TO INSTALL:
- multer (already installed)
- cloudinary
- multer-storage-cloudinary

ENV VARIABLES (.env):
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

NOTES:
- Backend handles video upload to Cloudinary
- Frontend uses URL from MongoDB to display video
- Existing authentication and validation remain
- Delete and get item routes unchanged
- System ready for local testing then deploy

NEXT STEP:
- Integrate push notification system (APN / Firebase)
- Configure server to send notifications when new posts/videos are added
- Obtain API keys / credentials from the push notification service
- Update backend routes to trigger notifications on new content
- Ensure Frontend is ready to receive/display notifications
